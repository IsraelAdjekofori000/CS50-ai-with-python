    "A knowledge based agent is an agent that reasons and take action based on an internal representation of information\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge base is a sysytem that conatains some sort of information about the world. Think of it as a database that tells us more about the world. With the information contained in the knowledge base, new information can be gotten from inferences made on the existing information.\n",
    "A knowledge base agent would have the ability to make these inferences using logical reasoning and would take actions based on the results of these inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Knowledge Is Represented In a Computer \n",
    "Because computers cannot store and process imformation as plain natural language like humans, some new techniques are developed so computers can understand and work with knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sentences\n",
    "This are statement or facts about the world and they represented using a __Knowlwdge Representation Language__ (KRL).\n",
    "Some type of KRL includes:\n",
    "1. Logical Representation (E.g. Propositional and predicate logic )\n",
    "2. Frame-based Representation (object representation)\n",
    "3. Semantic Networks (graph/node representation with edges representing relationship)\n",
    "4. Ontologies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepositional Logic:\n",
    "The prepositional logic uses symbols (E.g. ___P___, ___Q___, ... ) to represents assertions about the world and uses logical operators to relate these propositions. \n",

    "These logical operators include:"
