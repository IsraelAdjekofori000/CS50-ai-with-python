# CS50-ai-with-python
The repo is a practical recreation of the lessons in the CS50 AI with python course by Brian Yu and  David J. Malan of Harvard university

 You can find the course on the [Havard website](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python) or on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381PopUTYtMSstgk-hsTGkVm&si=ecOwF82qUtNNo3UV)

I would love for those interested in this course to play with the codes and notebooks in this repo, any issues found should be reported in the issues section.

You can find me on  [X/Twitter](https://x.com/adjekofori) and Linkdin

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsraelAdjekofori000/CS50-ai-with-python.git
cd CS50-ai-with-python
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   
   For Python 3.x:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   
   - On MacOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install the required dependencies**:
   
   If there's a `requirements.txt` file, run the following:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   In the terminal, run:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. This will open a new tab in your browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

3. Navigate to the notebook file, and you can start running the cells in the notebook.
